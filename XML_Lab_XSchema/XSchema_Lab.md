# XML Lab 2: XSchema

 ## Configure Eclipse with GitLab
 1. Open your GitLab account (If you are new on GitLab then register yourself on GitLab. See  [video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/2a478620-8bad-45da-98d6-eb3f2d9c17e2)).
 2. Add SSH keys to GitLab with Linux. More help see [video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/0be001a9-85fe-43a7-8a50-ab4a5afbbd22)
 3. Importing repository from GitLab to Eclipse. See [video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/fba33dae-0508-4c30-9382-9561d18ea802)
 4. Imported repository contains all task files (employee.xml, employee.xsd).
 5. When you complete the task `Commit and Push` it to GitLab repository.
  6. Pushing task commits from Eclipse to GitLab. See [video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/a332d698-37b9-47f1-84aa-c750e7f1e1bd)

## 1) Write a Valid XML and XShema documents

Weâ€™ll now consider storing details for employees in XML. First by defining an XML Schema, and ending up by creating an XML document that matches the schema.

1. Build a simple XML schema of an employee. The employee element of the schema needs to contain the following elements: job title, employee number, phone and email address. Assume there may be multiple phone numbers.
2. Extend the schema to restrict the employee number to be less than 1000, restrict the job title to be one of the following: prof, associate prof or assistant prof.
3. Make an XML document that conforms to your schema.
